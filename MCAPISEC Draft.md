# Multicloud API Security DRAFT

Welcome to the Multicloud API Security lab with F5. 

This time we're gonna explore the benefits of providing Central Security for Distributed or Mutlticloud APIs.
for this ocassion we'll need the next components
    - Azure account
    - Service principal
    - Some K8s knowledge would be greatly appreciated

### Why Multicloud APIs?
It's easy: why to have more than one link in your data centers?

Clouds are cool but they fail sometimes, like many stuff we know. Do not forget clouds are someone else's hardware, and we shouldn't trust 100% hardware.

Long story short we'll explore how can we protect APIs running in different clouds, helping business ease security implementation on real highly resilient scenarios.


## What are we gonna do today?

1. Deploy an API in Azure Kubernetes Service, which implies all the reources necessary to do so :)
2. Abuse the API!
3. Publish it on F5 Application Delivery Network
4. Protect it with our WAAP
5. Try attacks again!
6. Increase protection by using *Machine Learning*
7. attack and see SaaS Console.
8. Deploy API on a GKS cluster.
9. Add GKS API to F5 XC WAAP
10. Generate good & bad traffic and see results
